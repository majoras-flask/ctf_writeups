We are presented with the following challenge:

"Can you find out the location of the hacker using the IP in challenge 5?"

Given the hints of "Passion: Photography" and "fL!CK me  @  {bilalkharjilal337}", we presume his has flick account and he does:
flickr.com/bilalkharjilal337

He only has one photo. This one photo gave us way too many headaches. The first thing we did was download and use exiftool in Kali. We got the GPS coordinates and plugged into google maps. Takes us right to where the picture was taken. From here we tried every combination of Beirut/Lebanon/Lat-Long...EVERYTHING...

Then, I remembered a very popular exiftool and thought I'd try it to see if I was missing something: http://exif.regex.info/exif.cgi

Uploading the picture to the site, we see the coordinates: "33.891532, 35.505658". We already knew the coordinates but this was a shortened version.

After a few variations, we have our flag: flag{33.891532,35.505658}

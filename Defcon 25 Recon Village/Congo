We are presented with the following challenge:
"Paul was System Admin at x64 Corporation. He had an argument with his manager and left the company a few days back. Being disappointed, he started leaking sensitive data. He also deleted all of the employee records. Help our investigators to find his Phone number".

The main clue here is “left the company a few days back”. Using the way back machine for the x64-corp.com domain, we find a saved version of the page with Paul’s contact information:

Because the site was taken down, I don't have the full text for the challenge but here's what I do have:
"Our company doesn't spend a lot on paid products, and we use a lot of open source/free products. For example, we use git for version controlling - https://github.com/x64Corp.
Since teams don't use any centralized chat systems, it's difficult to monitor the same. Our CTO suspects that someone is keeping any eye on <don't have this but it was something about slack>."

Browsing to https://github.com/x64Corp, we see two contributors to the repo. If we click on malakhshou, we are taken to his page and see a repo called "private server - Forked from k2matsumoto/slack". Clicking on https://github.com/malakhshou/private_server, we are brought to a repo for x64corp's slack server. Looking at the recently updated files, we eventually come to https://github.com/malakhshou/private_server/blob/master/appengine_config.py. We notice a slack token but it just has "XXXX". Clicking on the history, we find a hardcoded API token:
https://github.com/malakhshou/private_server/commit/44a58b4fabc6b8a5057a37742e412b4610d1f128

We can use the slack API to plug in the token: https://slack.com/api/channels.list?token=xoxp-204882332822-203523130257-204081355250-8200a7efb0bec7fbd5894bf09bc7ab08

Sweet! We see a json response that has channel listings for x64corp but no flag!

Since we have channel IDs, let's see if we can look at the history. Using the "general channel", we can use the API to view the history:
https://slack.com/api/channels.history?token=xoxp-204882332822-203523130257-204081355250-8200a7efb0bec7fbd5894bf09bc7ab08&channel=C60RY9W8N

Aha! We can look at the json response and there's the flag: flag{myp@ssw0rdi5y0urfl4g}

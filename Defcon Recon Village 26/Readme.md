Collection of solved CTF challenges from the Recon Village at Defcon 26

My team, Cyber W00kiees ended up in 4th after being in 2nd for most of the game. We were the first to solve a handful of challenges and get the bonus points but sleep and frustration got in the way :) As always, it was fun and we learned some things.
